<p><h1><strong>SCOPE</strong></h1></p>
<p style="color:black; ">
 <span class="fstline"> With</span> the rapid advances in computing technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems, networking, Internet and the web and an ever increasing demand for practice of High Performance Computing (HPC). The evolving Cloud Computing as a branch of HPC facilitates convenient on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources like hardware, software, networks, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.<br /></p>
<p style="color: black;"><span class="fstline"> Beehive</span> research activity is witnessed worldwide on technical foundations of Cloud Computing that include Service Oriented Architecture(SOA), Virtualization of hardware and software and Service Oriented Computing (SOC) which utilizes Web Services to support distributed computing even in heterogeneous environments.<br /></p>
<p style="color:black;"><span class="fstline">The</span> primary objective of this Indo-US workshop on Cloud Computing and Web Services is to bring together researchers from academic institutions / R&amp;D organizations and practicing professionals for exchange of ideas/hypotheses and to discuss state-of-the-art  approaches and results of current research that can lead to the initiation of future research collaborations among the participating institutions and researchers on identified issues in cloud computing and web services.</p>
